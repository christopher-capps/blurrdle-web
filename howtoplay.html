            The goal of Blurrdle is simple: guess the word of the day in as few guesses as possible! Inspired by the NYT Crossword, 
            Blurrdle gets harder as the week goes on, and you are asked to guess longer and longer words.

            The primary difference between Blurrdle and Wordle is that you are given far less information 
            from each of your guesses. For each letter you guess, you are only told if that letter appears 
            in either that position or a position adjacent to where you guessed it to be. You are not told if 
            the letter you guessed is not in the word at all. Blurrdle does, however, track this information for you, 
            and keeps a running log of the information you have gained about the word thus far.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>Let's say the target word is "IRATE". If you were to guess "RANTS", you would recieve the following feedback:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr class="hits">
                    <td>A</td>
                    <td>A</td>
                    <td>T</td>
                    <td> </td>
                    <td> </td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="hits">
                    <td>R</td>
                    <td>R</td>
                    <td>A</td>
                    <td>T</td>
                    <td>T</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="guess">
                    <td>R</td>
                    <td>A</td>
                    <td>N</td>
                    <td>T</td>
                    <td>S</td>
                </tr>

            The letters R, A, and T were all "hits" - meaning that the Target Word contained those letters in the 
            same location or an adjacent location to the word that you guessed. Your job is to use this
             information to find the target word!
